# Pokémon Emerald

This is a decompilation of Pokémon Emerald based on [Pokémon Emerald](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald), enhancement so far include:

* RTC is now properly seeded at boot with seconds value.
* intro 1 scene can randomize between a Latios/Latias and Flygon.
* intro 2 scene can randomize between a cloud or tree filled background.
* Pokeblock escape factor during Safari game is fixed to not become 0, see [Pokeblock throw bug](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Hoenn_Safari_Zone#Pok.C3.A9block_throw_bug).

It builds the following ROM:

* [**pokeemerald.gba**](https://datomatic.no-intro.org/index.php?page=show_record&s=23&n=1961) `sha1: 64476d4c5102cb0e41564084c76b257f73ac0c71`

To set up the repository, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).
